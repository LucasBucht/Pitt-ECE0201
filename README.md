# Digital Circuits and Systems Projects

This repository contains VHDL projects written by me, Lucas Bucht, for **ECE 0201: Digital Circuits and Systems**.  
All designs target the **DE10-Lite** development board and are written, compiled, and simulated using:

- **Quartus Prime Lite 2018**
- **ModelSim (Intel/Altera Edition)**

The goal of this repo is to keep track of my course work, experiments, and small hardware modules as I continue learning digital logic and hardware design. Each folder includes its own set of files, testbenches, and notes.

## Project Index

Use this list to link to each subfolder. Add new entries as the repository grows.

1. [Lab 6: Intro to VHDL and FPGAs](Intro_To_FPGAs/)
2. [Lab 7: Designing Combinational Logic in VHDL](Combinational_Logic/)
3. [Lab 8: FPGA Synthesis & Behavioral VHDL](Behavioral_FPGA_Synthesis/)
4. [Lab 9: Latches, Registers, and Flip-Flops](Latches_FlipFlops_Registers/)
5. [Lab 10: Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design](RTL_Design/)
6. [Lab 11: Finite State Machines](FSM/)

## Repository Structure

Each project directory generally includes:

- **VHDL source files** for the design  
- **Testbench files** used for simulation in ModelSim
- **Notes** describing functionality, timing behavior, or design decisions

## How to Use This Repository

1. Open any project folder from the list above.  
2. Load the VHDL files into Quartus Prime Lite 2018.  
3. Assign pins for the DE10-Lite board if the project requires hardware testing.  
4. Run simulations in ModelSim to verify behavior.  
5. Compile and program the board through Quartus.
